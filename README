This work is intended to show the upgrade process of a module on drupal.org using community
tools. This study was performed as part of an internship at Acquia Inc during a period of 5
months. More specically it was focussed on creating a stable release of the Apache Solr Search
Integration Module for Drupal 7 and eventually also backport this to Drupal 6. Firstly there was
an analysis state and a brief introduction to how the system worked and how to co-operate with
an existing Open Source community. From this, existing problems were identied and thrown
in a roadmap. Community projects have a very dynamic rhythm and issues could rise up or
get resolved because thousands of persons had access to the code base. These challenges are
described and tips are given on how to cope with such a dynamic development process. This
study also describes the challenges of a backport and how to resolve them. Finally, there is an
explanation of the Acquia Search service and the process to upgrade the server park from Solr
1.4 to Solr 3.x (initially 3.4, nally 3.5) that includes the process of writing a Java servlet for
managing authentication over rest services using RFC2104 HMAC encryption.
