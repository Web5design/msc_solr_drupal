Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentor at Acquia, Peter Wolanin, for his continuous eye and ear he borrowed to me for about an hour a day. His perseverance, vision and immense knowledge helped me in completing all the work I've done. He also gave me the chance to sometimes tell me to step back and take my time to analyze. He also answered all my questions, wether they made sense or not. So thanks a dozen Peter!

Secondly I'd like to thanks Chris Brookins, together with Acquia as a company and all the employees at Acquia for being so awesome when it comes to support and convincing me that there are companies around that have a vision that fits in my ideology. I have always had a preference for Open Source companies and companies that did things a little bit different. All of the employees at Acquia deserve eternal gratitude for what they stand for and defending that publicly.

Also I'd like to thank Carles Farr√© for being my UPC mentor and supporting me in the bureaucratic process.

Finally I also want to thank my family and my girlfriend for their patience with me, since all I could talk about was this little blue alien! \footnote{Little blue alien commonly referred as Druplicon}
