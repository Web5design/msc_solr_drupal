\section{Community}

\paragraph{}
Before you, the reader, will dive into deep specifics of Apache Solr and Drupal there are a couple things you should know in advance. Firstly this work is the result of many hours hard work and not only from me but from a complete community. These communities have changed the way I look at software. In programming classes in university a student is taught a different way of designing software, namely that the control is fully his. I had numerous courses going from basic Java to Advanced Web Technologies to IBM rational rose project management. And while I personally have learned a lot from these courses it has always been my understanding that what is taught is just another way of creating solutions for existing problems.

Working in a community is, similarly, another way of creating solutions for a set of existing problems but involves a different way of making decisions and looking at software. It is great if your code can be shared and used across thousands of people and be corrected by those same group of people. While code will never be perfect, different people have used the same codebase to solve existing problems and they have been saving time and resources. I would like to thank Acquia for being very clear in regards of the benefits of sharing knowledge because it is also my personal belief that this is important for everyone to grow and to contribute to do good.
