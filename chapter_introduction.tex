\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Web and Search}

\paragraph{}
It wouldn't be wrong to start with a quote from the famous paper of Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page. "The web creates new challenges for information retrieval. The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly, as well as the number of new users inexperienced in the art of web research. People are likely to surf the web using its link graph" \cite{google_paper}
In my personal opinion I also experienced that people "Google" more and more and this phenomenon intrigued me and many others. The web won't stop growing and content is added in amounts that we can't imagine. Even though Google does its very best to index every piece of content it still lacks in a more customizable way to find data. You, as a reader, will probably already have searched in depth in a search engine other than Google. For example, ebay.com has a very specific search engine that allows their customers to find products and goods that are are exactly what to user is searching for by narrowing down the results using Facets \footnote{A faceted classification system allows the assignment of an object to multiple characteristics (attributes), enabling the classification to be ordered in multiple ways, rather than in a single, predetermined, taxonomic order. For example, a collection of books might be classified using an author facet, a subject facet, a date facet, etc.}

Another missing piece in the search part of the global web is the ability to search in restricted content. Say, for example, an intranet can't benefit from a global search, hence a search engine that indexes content in a customized way is necessary. 

A numerous amount of projects \footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_enterprise_search_vendors} has a list with most of the current enterprise search solutions}allow you to customize the indexing process while still supporting hundreds of thousands \glspl{document} which contains \glspl{field} with customized data. Creating an application that includes integration with access permissions is not easy but it is do-able.

\section{Open Source \& Community}
\paragraph{}
This work is the result of many hours hard work and not only from myself, as the author but also from a complete community. These communities have changed the way how we look at software. In programming classes in university a student is taught a different way of designing software, the control of this process is fully his. There are numerous courses going from basic Java to Advanced Web Technologies to IBM rational rose project management in the FIB department of the UPC. While you can learn a ton from these courses it is never enough and by being an active member of a community the obligation you have to follow and participate in life-long learning is fulfilled. Every day there might be an aha-erlebnis \footnote{An insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the German word Aha-Erlebnis. It is also known as an epiphany.} or frustrations but in the end it is worthwhile for the personal evolution. 

Also, since this topic is about Search Applications and Web Applications we only focus on Open Source tools that help us in achieving our goals. See section \ref{chap:description} on page \pageref{chap:description} to find out more about the specifics of these tools and why these tools were chosen. 

\paragraph{}
Working in a community is, similarly, another way of creating solutions for a set of existing problems but involves a different way of making decisions and looking at software. It is great if the code that is written can be shared and is being used by thousands of people and can be corrected by those same group of people. While code will never be perfect, different people have used the same codebase to solve existing problems and they have been saving time and resources. The company where this thesis was executed, Acquia \footnote{\url{http://www.acquia.com}}, is doing an fantastic job in supporting these very necessary skills and promoting shared knowledge.

As Dries Buytaert, the man who initially built Drupal and founded Acquia, once said : 
\begin{quote}First, Open Source adoption in the enterprise is trending at an incredible rate -- Drupal adoption has grown a lot in 2009 but we saw by far the biggest relative growth in the enterprise. Fueling this movement is the notion that Open Source options present an innovative, economically friendly and more secure alternative to their costly proprietary counterparts. Second, Cloud Computing is a transformational movement in that it enables continual innovation and updating - not to mention a highly expandable infrastructure that will reduce the burden on your IT team.

It is no surprise that Acquia's strategy is closely aligned with those two trends: Drupal Gardens, Acquia Hosting and Acquia Search are all built on Open Source tools and delivered as Software as a Service in the cloud. Combining Open Source tools and Cloud Computing makes for the perfect storm for success. It provides real value to end-users and it enables companies to monetize Open Source. It creates a win-win situation. \footnote{\url{http://buytaert.net/open-source-in-the-enterprise-and-in-the-cloud}} \end{quote}

This quote mentions Acquia Search, the service that combines Apache Solr (The chosen search engine in this work) and Drupal to provide a superior search solution as a service especially focussed on integrating Drupal with Apache Solr in the Cloud. Everything that is done to improve this has also been open sourced, including this work.
